# Each Student has a {#name} and may also have a {Teacher}.  Students can
# progress through {Lesson}s and {LessonPart}s.  This progress is recorded via
# the {#lesson_part} attribute (the {#lesson} is then delegated to
# {#lesson_part}).

  #     progressed to.  This can be `nil` (and can be set to `nil`) to indicate
  #     that the student has made no progress.
